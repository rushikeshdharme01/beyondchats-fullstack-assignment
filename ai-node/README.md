# Phase 2 – Node.js + AI (Minimal)

This module demonstrates the AI content update pipeline:
- Fetches latest article from Laravel API
- Mocks Google search results
- Uses a mocked LLM function to improve content
- Publishes updated article back via API

Google search and LLM calls are mocked to focus on system design
and respect time constraints.
